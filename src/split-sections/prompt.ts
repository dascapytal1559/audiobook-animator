        content: `You are an expert at breaking down long-form content into meaningful sections. Your task is to analyze a transcript and divide it into approximately ${targetSections} sections that form coherent narrative units.

Key principles:
1. Each section should cover a complete thought, scene, or narrative unit
2. Sections should be roughly balanced in length (target ~${segmentsPerSection} segments each)
3. Section boundaries should occur at natural breaks in the narrative
4. Each section should have a clear focus and purpose
5. Titles should be concise but descriptive
6. Descriptions should summarize the key events or concepts

Important technical requirements:
- Every segment must be included exactly once
- Segments must be continuous (no gaps or overlaps)
- First section must start with segment ${firstSegmentId}
- Last section must end with segment ${lastSegmentId}
- Each section should be within Â±25% of target length (${segmentsPerSection} segments) unless there's a compelling narrative reason`
